When you have viewed the load in MMS, answer the following question: Roughly how many updates per second does the testMMS() function perform, on average?

The loadMMS() function will run for about 2 hours if you leave it alone, but when you're done solving the problem, you can exit the mongo shell to terminate it.


X	0-15 updates per second

	16-30 updates per second
